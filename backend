Back End Assessment

DUE DATE: 48 hours from when you received the email, good luck!


The goal of the assignment is to see the quality of the code you write, a production level application is not needed. Try to complete the task as much as you can but do not feel pressured to take tasks to 100% completion.


Create a simple social media application. DO NOT BUILD A USER INTERFACE, just a backend exposing a well-formed API. You can use anything you want for the server and storage layer. The API must adhere to REST standards. Focus on completing the basic functionality before moving on to the rest. The code you write is expected to be good quality, it should:


    Have correct formatting
    Have resilient error handling
    Exceptions should appropriate handling
    Architecture should be scalable, easy to maintain
    Tricky parts of the code should have proper documentation
    NOTE: Database queries should be efficient


TASK 1:


Section 1


    User registration using unique username and a password
    User login (Including session maintenance using any means you’re comfortable with)
    Unit tests for these basic methods


These two APIs should not have any errors. DO NOT move on to the remainder of the assignment until these are completed. If either of these APIs are missing or incomplete, the remainder of the assignment can not be marked properly and your submission will be invalid.


Section 2


Reminder: Please complete section 1 fully before attempting section 2. Complete the next tasks *in the order specified*


    Create, read, update, delete tweet (Twitter doesn’t support update, can you?)
    Unit/Integration tests for *all* endpoints you’ve built so far (Basic & Extended Functionality)


**THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS OPTIONAL*


*Section 3


Start *only* once section 1 and 2 functionality is complete. The following endpoints are for bonus points, and you SHOULD NOT attempt them until all previous requirements are completed.


    Like/unlike a tweet
    Retweet
    Threading


TASK 2:


Build a stock market tracking system where user’s can trade stocks or shares.


> Your system should have support for users to login/logout.

> Users should be able to add balance to their wallet.

> Users should be able to buy/sell shares (transactions need not be stored)

> Users should be able to subscribe to an endpoint that should provide live rates.

> Users should have the ability to see their portfolio


-------------


Complete what you can from the assessment to the best of your ability and submit to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYU8P-RlgCcl8eI8vttI7AI-8OfywP-YFzkWzML_apXj4bSA/viewform?usp=sf_link.


Along with your code, please provide instructions on how to run it and API documentation.


Just show us you can write excellent code and that would be enough! Best of luck!


Please host it on your Github repository with detailed commits!
